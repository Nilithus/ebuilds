# Gentoo ebuilds
This repo holds gentoo ebuilds for installing software on an x86_64 gentoo
server

# Why
1. Learn a bit about creating gentoo packages
2. Maybe start my own overlay in the future
3. For fun and knowledge

# Disclaimer
These packages are not rigourisly tested beyond my personal gentoo machine.
Some might not even work correctly.
